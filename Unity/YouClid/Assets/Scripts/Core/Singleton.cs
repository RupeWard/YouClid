/**
 * Below are several singleton implementations that all have different purposes. 
 * Each singleton will stop fetching of the singleton instance if it has been detected that we're shutting down.
 * This will stop singletons from being recreated when it isn't not required.
 * There are scene singletons which have the lifetime of a scene, when you change scene they will be destroyed
 * Application singletons are singletons that will remain for the entire application life. They will be destroyed on application quit.
 * 
 * Any second instance of the singleton game object will be destroyed immediately (with a warning message).
 * 
 * Instead of using Awake, OnDestroy and OnApplicationQuit in derived classes use PostAwake, PostOnDestroy and PostOnApplicationQuit. 
 * These are NOT called if the game object being instantiated is a second instance of the singleton
 * If you override Awake, OnDestroy or OnApplicationQuit in derived classes then you will get a compiler warning in Unity
 * 
 * SingletonSceneLifetime: A singleton that lasts for an entire scene, the GameObject NEEDS TO BE PRESENT in the scene for the singleton instance to be cached
 *                          We block the instance being fetched until one game object in the scene of the required type has been awaken, after which we cache the instance.

 * SingletonApplicationLifetime:  A singleton that lasts for an entire application, the GameObject NEEDS TO BE PRESENT in the FIRST scene for the singleton instance to be cached
 *                          We block the instance from being fetched until one game object in the scene of the required type has been awaken, after which we cache the instance.
 *                          
 * SingletonApplicationLifetimeLazy: A singleton that lasts for an entire application, the GameObject will be created and added to the scene (and never destroyed until application quit)
 *                          We create the game object and add it to the scene
 * 
 * Singleton: Regular old singleton, not associated with any Unity object
